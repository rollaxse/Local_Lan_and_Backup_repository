#architecture 
This lab environment was designed to replicate a small enterprise IT environment using centralized management, role separation, and controlled access to system resources.
The environment consists of an employee workstation, a domain controller, and a dedicated backup server. Each system is assigned a specific role to reflect common enterprise infrastructure practices.
The employee workstation represents a standard end-user system used for daily work and file access. User accounts on this system operate with standard privileges and do not have administrative access. 
The domain controller is responsible for centralized authentication, user account management, and enforcing security policies across the environment. 
The backup server functions as a centralized storage and recovery point and is isolated from end-user access.
The environment was built using multiple virtual machines to allow realistic testing without impacting the host system. 
All virtual machines were stored and run from an external SSD to improve performance and allow the lab to be easily moved, backed up, or restored. 
This setup also mirrors real-world practices where virtual infrastructure is separated from primary systems for flexibility and reliability.
Each virtual machine was configured with separate roles and controlled access, allowing the environment to support user restriction testing, policy enforcement, and backup and recovery workflows. 
Using virtualization made it possible to simulate real-world administrative tasks, test recovery scenarios, and safely validate changes without risk to production systems.
