# GPO 
Group Policy Objects (GPOs) were used to centrally manage user permissions and enforce security restrictions across the environment. Policies were applied through the domain controller to ensure consistent enforcement on domain-joined systems, regardless of user actions on the workstation.



GPOs were used to restrict standard user access to administrative tools and sensitive system functionality. This included limiting access to command-line utilities and system configuration tools to prevent unauthorized changes. Administrative privileges were reserved for authorized accounts only, allowing system management tasks to be performed securely.



By enforcing policies at the domain level, the environment maintains centralized control and ensures restrictions persist even after system reboots or user logins. This approach mirrors common enterprise practices where Group Policy is used to manage user behavior, reduce security risk, and support controlled recovery and troubleshooting workflows.
