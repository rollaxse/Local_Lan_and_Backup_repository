#VM-Setup
This lab was built using Oracle VirtualBox as the virtualization platform. VirtualBox was chosen because it is commonly used in lab and learning environments and allows full control over hardware resources, networking, and storage configuration.



Each virtual machine was created manually to reflect a real-world deployment process. The operating systems were installed using official ISO images mounted directly to each virtual machine. During setup, standard installation procedures were followed, including disk selection, user creation, and operating system configuration.



Virtual machine resources such as CPU cores, memory, and storage were allocated based on the role of each system. The employee workstation was configured to reflect a typical end-user system, while the domain controller and backup server were allocated additional resources to support authentication services and backup operations.
